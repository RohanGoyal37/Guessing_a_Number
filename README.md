# 🎮 The Ultimate Number Guessing Game

> Can you outsmart a Python script? Spoiler alert: It's harder than it sounds! 😅

## 🎯 What's This About?

Welcome to the most intense psychological thriller of our generation... okay, maybe not. But it's definitely a fun number guessing game where you battle against your computer's cold, calculating logic. The computer picks a number, you try to guess it. Simple? Sure. Easy? We'll see about that! 😏

## 🎲 How to Lose... I Mean, Play

1. **Computer thinks of a number** (and refuses to tell you because it's rude like that)
2. **You make a guess** (probably wrong, let's be honest)
3. **Computer mocks you** (okay, it gives you hints... same thing)
4. **Repeat until you win** (or your ego gives up)

It's just you vs. a lines of code that has zero mercy! 💀
